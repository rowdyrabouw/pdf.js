<p>It's <em>very highly</em> recommended to <em>not</em> use these files, but rather use the
pre-built library as found in e.g. the <code>/build</code>, <code>/web</code>, and <code>/image_decoders</code>
folders in the root of this repository.</p>
<p>Please note that the &quot;lib&quot; build target exists mostly to enable unit-testing in
Node.js/Travis, and that you'll need to handle e.g. any Node.js dependencies
yourself if using the files in this folder.</p>
