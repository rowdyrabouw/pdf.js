<h1>PDF.js</h1>
<p>PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) library that is built with HTML5.
Our goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for
parsing and rendering PDFs.</p>
<p>This is a pre-built version of the PDF.js source code. It is automatically
generated by the build scripts.</p>
<p>For usage with older browsers/environments, without support for modern features
such as e.g. <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, <code>Promise</code>, and <code>ReadableStream</code>,
please refer to the <code>es5</code> folder.</p>
